# CAUSES OF DEATH ANALYSIS

The project aims to analyze the causes of death dataset to gain insights into mortality patterns across different age groups and genders. Understanding the leading causes of death is valuable for public health priorities, disease prevention strategies, and healthcare resource allocation. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify trends, disparities, and potential areas for intervention to improve population health outcomes.

## Problem Description
In this analysis, I have addressed the following questions:
* What are the trends in causes of death over the years for different age groups and genders?
* What are the top three causes of death across all years and genders?
* Are there any gender disparities in mortality rates for specific causes of death?
* Can we identify any significant trends or patterns in the causes of death based on gender and age groups over the years?
* Is there any correlation between the number of deaths for different age groups and genders?
